### Links and Resources
* [Lab02 Submission](https://jenjones319.github.io/code201lab2/)
* [GitHub Reference Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) - this is a handy reference to remember some of the things beyond ACP. We haven't covered some of the commands, yet. 
### Reflections and Comments
* I will be adding additional .html files as we go along. I also look forward to updating the if/else statements as we learn new things.
